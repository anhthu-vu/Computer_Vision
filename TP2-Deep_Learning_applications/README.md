In these practical sessions, we . To be more specific: 

- In `2-a: Transfer Learning` section, we implemented a transfer learning framework using the entire VGG16 network-except for its last two layers-with pretrained weights on ImageNet. We combined this with several downstream architectures, including a linear SVC and a fully connected layer (with and without propagating the gradients to the rest of the network), to perform a classification task on the 15 Scene dataset. We then conducted an analysis and comparisons on the test results.
