# Computer_Vision
This repository contains the programming exercises that I did during the practical sessions of the Pattern Recognition for Image Analysis and Interpretation (RDFIA) course in M2A program at Sorbonne Universit√©.

In each source code file, the code between #TODO and #END TODO was written by me, while the other parts are provided.

Please refer to [the website of the course](https://rdfia.github.io/) for more details.
